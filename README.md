## About The Project

![Screen Shot](readme-images/example.PNG)

This is a fairly simple site coded using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make simple games accessible all in one website. In the future, there will be matching games, snake, and more!

Here's why:

* This website can be used among friends to try and beat each other's high scores and/or easily access games everyone loves to play
* Who doesnt love playing fun games in one simple site
* Well... So you can have fun :smile:

Of course, these games can be found on other websites but not found as easily and in one place as my website is able to provide.

## Built With

This website was build using the following languages:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## Getting Started

Simply type the website into your browser's search bar and start playing!

## Usage

The Up, Down, Left, and Right Arrow Keys are used to control the snake while playing. 

## Roadmap
